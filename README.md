# Error Calculation Script

Welcome to our **ERROR CALCULATION SCRIPT**, an indispensable tool for **SCIENTISTS**, **ENGINEERS**, and **RESEARCHERS**. This Python script is adept at quantifying the accuracy of simulation outcomes by computing both **ABSOLUTE** and **RELATIVE ERRORS** relative to a theoretical **TRUE VALUE**. It's tailored for scrutinizing the precision of various simulations, shedding light on the **PERFORMANCE** and **RELIABILITY** of your experimental methodologies.

## Features

- **CALCULATE ABSOLUTE ERRORS**: Seamlessly ascertain the absolute discrepancy of your simulation outcomes from the expected benchmarks.
- **CALCULATE RELATIVE ERRORS**: Gain insight into the relative discrepancy of your results as a percentage, offering a lucid view of your simulations' accuracy.
- **EASE OF USE**: Input your array of measured values and the true value to commence.
- **BROAD APPLICATION**: Perfectly suited for a diverse array of disciplines including **PHYSICS**, **ENGINEERING**, **BIOLOGY**, and beyond.

## Usage

This script is straightforward and necessitates minimal configuration. Simply supply your measured values from simulations alongside the theoretical true value to assess the precision of your data meticulously.

Elevate the **RELIABILITY** and **ACCURACY** of your research and experimental endeavors with our error calculation script. Delve into the nuances of your simulations with unprecedented precision and ease!
